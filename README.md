# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The script for this project is in the run_analysis.R file. It takes the training and test data sets and merges them, extracting only the mean and standard deviation measurements to produce a tidy data set. This set contains the average of each measurement grouped by the activity name, and the subject that performed the activity.

See Code Book.txt for more information about each of the variables in the data set.
